# Todo List

This is a project I created by myself as part of the Odin Project. I wanted to use this project as a way to show off what I have learned. Because of this I intend to include this as a project on my portfolio.

<h4>What I Learned</h4>
<ul>
<li>I feel like I solidified all previous knowledge. I feel very confident with all of the basic functions of Javascript</li>
<li>I feel able to understand what is going wrong so that I can debug as well as use guides to help me</li>
<li>While initially overwhelmed by the project, I broke it down into chunks which helped me work faster and more effectively</li>

<h4>Mistakes to Learn From</h4>
<ul>
<li>At times I would make a mistake and have to rewrite code.

This can be resolved by learning more about Git</li>
<li>While I tried to keep to the OOP principles, my code still felt messy.

I need to learn to name things better and use // to help my keep record of what I’m working on between coding sessions</li>

<h4>Future Improvements</h4>
<p>My biggest problem at the moment is that I do not know how to deploy this website. This is crucial as I want to use it as a portfolio project. I have spent a lot of time on this project and don’t believe there are that many improvements I could make. If pushed I might add a notes page as initially intended as well as formatting for mobile devices. I also used local storage and am unaware as to what my other options are.</p>
